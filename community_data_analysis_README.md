# Community Data Analysis

This Python script, `community_data_analysis.py`, retrieves, processes, and analyzes data from an API endpoint. The script imports necessary libraries, defines the API endpoint and parameters, makes an API request, and stores the response. It then converts the response into a pandas DataFrame, cleans and preprocesses the data, calculates summary statistics, and prints the results.

### Libraries Used

- pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for Python.
- numpy: A library for numerical computing in Python.
- requests: A library for making HTTP requests in Python.
- json: A library for working with JSON data in Python.

### API Request

The script defines the API endpoint and parameters, then makes a GET request using the `requests` library. The response is stored as a JSON object and then converted into a pandas DataFrame for further processing.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The script performs the following data cleaning and preprocessing steps:

1. Drops rows with missing values using `dropna()`.
2. Converts the 'date' column to a datetime object using `pd.to_datetime()`.
3. Converts the 'value' column to a float data type using `astype(float)`.

### Summary Statistics

The script calculates the following summary statistics for the 'value' column:

- Mean value: The average of all values in the column.
- Max value: The highest value in the column.
- Min value: The lowest value in the column.

These statistics are then printed to the console.

### Usage

To use this script, replace the `enter_your_token` placeholder in the `params` dictionary with your API token. You can also modify the `date` parameter to retrieve data for a different date.

Run the script using the following command:

```
python community_data_analysis.py
```

The script will output the calculated summary statistics for the 'value' column.
