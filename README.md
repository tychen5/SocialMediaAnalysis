**Analyze Social Media Posts**


Due to confidentiality agreements and commercial secrecy, sensitive algorithms or information/data have been removed or replaced in this project. What remains are the algorithmic processes developed using open-source tools. If the Python script files or the project appears incomplete, it's due to the removal of algorithmic content that may potentially lead to legal disputes. The README files corresponding to each code may retain more implementation methods or details. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.
