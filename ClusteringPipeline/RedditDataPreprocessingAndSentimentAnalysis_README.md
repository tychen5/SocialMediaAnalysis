# Reddit Data Preprocessing and Sentiment Analysis

This Python script preprocesses Reddit data, performs sentiment analysis, and categorizes comments using the XLM-RoBERTa model. The script is divided into several sections, including data loading, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and language identification.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

1. Load Reddit data from a pickle file.
2. Filter and preprocess the data by removing unwanted content, checking for bad list and substring list, and converting timestamps to datetime format.
3. Rename and reorder columns in the dataframe.
4. Define a function `clean_comments` to clean comments by removing unwanted content and checking for bad list and substring list.
5. Apply the `clean_comments` function and filter the dataframe.

### Sentiment Analysis

1. Load the XLM-RoBERTa sentiment analysis model.
2. Define functions `xlm_sentiment_local` and `chk_null` to perform sentiment analysis and check for null or empty messages.
3. Apply the sentiment analysis functions and update the dataframe.
4. Save the processed dataframe as a pickle file.

### Language Identification

1. Define a function `define_language` to determine the language of the input text using various language identification methods.
2. Apply the `define_language` function to the dataframe.

### Category Model

1. Define a custom PyTorch model `MyBert` that uses the XLM-RoBERTa model for multilabel classification.
2. Load the pretrained model and tokenizer.
3. Create a custom PyTorch dataset and dataloader for the Reddit data.
4. Load the labeled dataframe and perform category classification using the custom model.
