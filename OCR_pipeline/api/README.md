# Text Extraction Postprocessing

This Python script is designed to process and clean up text data obtained from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. The primary goal of this script is to enhance the quality and readability of the extracted text, making it more suitable for further analysis or processing.

### Features

1. **Text Cleaning**: The script removes any unwanted characters, such as special symbols, numbers, or punctuation marks, from the extracted text. This ensures that the output is clean and easy to read.

2. **Whitespace Management**: The script intelligently handles whitespace characters, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, to maintain the original formatting and structure of the text.

3. **Error Correction**: The script employs various techniques to correct common OCR errors, such as character misrecognition or word segmentation issues. This helps improve the overall accuracy of the extracted text.

4. **Language Support**: The script is designed to work with multiple languages, making it versatile and adaptable to various OCR systems and text sources.

### Dependencies

To use this script, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you may need to install specific libraries or modules, depending on the OCR system you are using.

### Usage

To use the `text_extraction_postprocessing.py` script, simply import it into your Python project and call the appropriate functions with the extracted text data as input. The script will then process the text and return the cleaned and corrected output.

```python
from text_extraction_postprocessing import process_extracted_text

# Assuming 'raw_text' contains the text data extracted from an OCR system
processed_text = process_extracted_text(raw_text)
```

### Customization

The script can be easily customized to suit your specific needs or requirements. For example, you can modify the list of unwanted characters to be removed from the text, or you can adjust the error correction techniques to better handle specific OCR issues.
