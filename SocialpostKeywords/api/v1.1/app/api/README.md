# Keyword Extraction

This Python script is designed to extract and analyze keywords from a given text input. The script processes the input text and identifies the most relevant keywords, which can be used for various purposes such as search engine optimization, text summarization, or topic modeling.

### Features

- Extracts keywords from a given text input
- Analyzes the frequency and relevance of the extracted keywords
- Provides a list of the most important keywords for further processing

### Dependencies

To run this script, you will need the following Python libraries:

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- spaCy
- Gensim

Please make sure to install these libraries before running the script.

### Usage

To use the `keyword_extraction.py` script, simply import it into your Python project and call the main function with the desired text input:

```python
from keyword_extraction import extract_keywords

text = "Your input text goes here."
keywords = extract_keywords(text)

print(keywords)
```

The `extract_keywords` function will return a list of the most relevant keywords found in the input text.

### Customization

You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the following parameters:

- `num_keywords`: The number of keywords to return (default is 10)
- `min_word_length`: The minimum length of a keyword (default is 3)
- `stopwords`: A list of words to exclude from the keyword extraction process (default is an empty list)

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the `keyword_extraction.py` script:

```python
from keyword_extraction import extract_keywords

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
keywords = extract_keywords(text, num_keywords=5, min_word_length=4)

print(keywords)
```

This will output the following list of keywords:

```
['quick', 'brown', 'jumps', 'lazy']
```
