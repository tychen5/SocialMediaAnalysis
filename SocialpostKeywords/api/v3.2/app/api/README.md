# Keyword Extraction

 The script utilizes natural language processing techniques to identify and return the most important words or phrases that best represent the main topics discussed in the input text.

### Features

- Tokenization: The script breaks down the input text into individual words or tokens.
- Stopword removal: Common words that do not carry significant meaning are filtered out.
- Lemmatization: Words are reduced to their base or dictionary form, which helps in identifying similar words with different forms.
- Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF): This statistical measure is used to evaluate the importance of each word in the text.
- Keyword extraction: The script returns a list of the most relevant keywords based on their TF-IDF scores.

### Dependencies

To run this script, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `nltk`: A popular library for natural language processing tasks.
- `sklearn`: A library for machine learning and data mining in Python.

### Usage

To use the `keyword_extraction.py` script, simply import it into your Python project and call the `extract_keywords` function with the input text as an argument. The function will return a list of the most relevant keywords.

Example:

```python
from keyword_extraction import extract_keywords

text = "This is a sample text for keyword extraction."
keywords = extract_keywords(text)

print(keywords)
```

### Customization

You can customize the number of keywords returned by the script by modifying the `num_keywords` parameter in the `extract_keywords` function. By default, it is set to 10.

```python
keywords = extract_keywords(text, num_keywords=5)
```

### Conclusion

The `keyword_extraction.py` script is a powerful tool for extracting meaningful keywords from any given text. It can be easily integrated into various applications, such as search engines, content analysis tools, and text summarization systems.
