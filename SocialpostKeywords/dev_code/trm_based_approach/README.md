# Inference API

 The purpose of this script is to provide an easy-to-use interface for making predictions using the model, allowing users to input data and receive the corresponding output.

### Features

- Load a pre-trained machine learning model
- Perform inference using the loaded model
- Handle user input and output in a user-friendly manner
- Provide a simple API for integrating with other applications

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn)
- Required libraries for the specific model being used

### Usage

1. Ensure that the required Python libraries and pre-trained model are installed and available.
2. Import the `inference_api.py` script into your project.
3. Instantiate the InferenceAPI class with the appropriate model and configuration.
4. Call the `predict()` method with the input data to receive the model's output.


To use the `inference_api.py` script, follow these steps:

1. Import the `InferenceAPI` class from the script:

   ```python
   from inference_api import InferenceAPI
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `InferenceAPI` class, providing the path to the pre-trained model file:

   ```python
   api = InferenceAPI(model_path="path/to/your/model.pkl")
   ```

3. Use the `predict` method to perform inference using the loaded model:

   ```python
   input_data = [...]  # Your input data as a list or numpy array
   prediction = api.predict(input_data)
   ```

4. The `predict` method will return the model's prediction for the given input data.

### Example

```python
from inference_api import InferenceAPI

# Load the pre-trained model
model = load_your_pretrained_model()

# Instantiate the InferenceAPI class
inference_api = InferenceAPI(model)

# Perform inference using the API
input_data = get_input_data()
output_data = inference_api.predict(input_data)

# Display the results
print("Predicted output:", output_data)
```

Here's a simple example of how to use the `inference_api.py` script:

```python
from inference_api import InferenceAPI

# Load the pre-trained model
api = InferenceAPI(model_path="path/to/your/model.pkl")

# Perform inference using the loaded model
input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
prediction = api.predict(input_data)

# Print the prediction
print("Prediction:", prediction)
```


### Customization

The `inference_api.py` script can be easily customized to work with different machine learning models and libraries. To do this, simply modify the `load_model()` and `predict()` methods to handle the specific model and library being used.
