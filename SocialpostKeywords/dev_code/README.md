# Keyword Merger and Scorer

This Python script is designed to merge and score keywords from multiple sources. The primary purpose of this script is to help users identify the most relevant and important keywords for their projects, based on the frequency and weight of the keywords in the input data.

### Features

1. Merging keywords from multiple sources.
2. Scoring keywords based on frequency and weight.
3. Sorting keywords by their scores.
4. Outputting the sorted list of keywords.

### How it works

The script takes input from multiple sources, such as CSV files, JSON files, or APIs, and processes the data to extract keywords. It then merges the keywords from all sources, removing duplicates and maintaining a count of occurrences for each keyword.

Next, the script calculates a score for each keyword based on its frequency and weight. The weight can be determined by the user or derived from the input data, such as the importance of the source or the relevance of the keyword to the project.

Once the scores are calculated, the script sorts the keywords by their scores in descending order, so that the most relevant and important keywords appear at the top of the list.

Finally, the script outputs the sorted list of keywords, which can be used for further analysis or as input for other tools and applications.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- numpy (for numerical operations)

### Usage

To use the keyword_merger_and_scorer script, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries, if not already installed:

```
pip install pandas numpy
```

2. Prepare your input data in the desired format (CSV, JSON, etc.) and ensure that the script can access the data.

3. Modify the script to read your input data and set the appropriate weights for the keywords.

4. Run the script


5. Review the output file or console output for the sorted list of keywords.

### Customization

The script can be easily customized to accommodate different input formats, scoring algorithms, and output formats. Users can modify the script to read data from different sources, apply custom weights to the keywords, or change the sorting order of the keywords.

### Conclusion

The script is a versatile and powerful tool for merging and scoring keywords from multiple sources. By providing a clear and concise output of the most relevant and important keywords, this script can greatly assist users in their projects and research.
